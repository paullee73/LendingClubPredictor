Predict loan charge-offs from Lending Club data

Here, we only use data that would be available to investors prior to investing a loan. We use a combination of
logistic regression, random forest classifier, and k-nearest neighbors. The logistic regression (optimized with stochiastic
gradient descent) produced to most accurate predictions for charge-offs (at around 70%). The lending club data was obtained
from here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club).
